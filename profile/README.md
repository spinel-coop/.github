### The Ruby open source maintainers' cooperative

Spinel is a cooperative of Ruby open source maintainers, inspired by Geomys.

Spinel maintains the Ruby language packaging ecosystem, and acts as maintainer of last resort for the Ruby ecosystem. Our portfolio includes:

- rv, the ultimate Ruby version manager and gem tool

A Spinel retainer offers organizations the opportunity to ensure the sustainability of their foundational Ruby dependencies, and direct access to the expertise of the maintainers.

If you’re betting your business on a critical open source technology, you

1. want it to be sustainably and predictably maintained; and
2. need occasional access to expertise that would be blisteringly expensive to acquire and retain.

Getting maintainers on retainer solves both problems for a fraction of the cost of a fully-loaded full-time engineer. From the maintainers’ point of view, it’s steady income to keep doing what they do best. It’s a great deal for both sides.

We'd love to hear from you. You can reach us at hello@ our domain name.
